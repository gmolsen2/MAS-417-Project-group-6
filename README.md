# MAS 417 Project group 6

This project will call a map from https://kartkatalog.geonorge.no API. It will then convert the map to a 3D file by converting light intensity to height of the model. Lastly it will print the file as .stl and show it using matplotlib. 

It is developed for Python 3.9.7. 

Written as a group effort.
