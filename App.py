# Basic use of open API Kartverket wms.hoyde-dom for getting elevation data in a specific area (Norway only).
#
# 1. Go to https://kartkatalog.geonorge.no
# 2. Find and add WMS service "Digital overflatemodell WMS".
# 3. Press "Vis kart", or go to for example this URL to view an area and enable the surface model in left menu:
#    https://kartkatalog.geonorge.no/kart?lat=6882011.719407242&lon=68429.52888256384&zoom=8.589318931685455
#
#
# Note:
# Example code for UiA MAS417 project. Easy-to-follow demonstration on how to use a WMS API to fetch an image and
# display it. In addition to converting the image to a numpy array for analysis, manipulation, enhancement, and so on.
